Kubernetes Jobs and Cronjobs are powerful tools that present some interesting challenges to monitoring. We’ll demonstrate rules using kube-state-metrics and Prometheus to monitor and alert on failed jobs. We’ll discuss how the rules were formulated, and how to leverage Prometheus label matching techniques for advanced alerting.</description>

I’m going to take a break from our series on Production Kubernetes to write up a couple of smaller articles on Prometheus. This article will give an overview of Apdex, and go on to describe a practical approach to implementing Apdex alerts in Prometheus.</description>

In this post, we will show a worked example of building a Prometheus alert for a typical user facing service.
Introduction At Qubit we have recently completely
a migration from our legacy Shinken and Graphite based monitoring to a system built around Prometheus, a modern time series database.</description>

      <title>Time Series Search in Prometheus</title>

      <description>Note: This post describes an extension to Prometheus that is unlikely to ever make it upstream, and definitely not in its current form.
Time Series Indexing When we talk about an index for a time-series database, we are usually talking about an index of the metadata. In the case of Prometheus, such an index would help us locate all the series with certain labels, allowing us to quickly query, for example, all the http_requests_total timeseries that match a given handler or response code.</description>
