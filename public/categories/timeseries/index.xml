Iâ€™m going to take a break from our series on Production Kubernetes to write up a couple of smaller articles on Prometheus. This article will give an overview of Apdex, and go on to describe a practical approach to implementing Apdex alerts in Prometheus.</description>

      <title>Time Series Search in Prometheus</title>

Time Series Indexing When we talk about an index for a time-series database, we are usually talking about an index of the metadata. In the case of Prometheus, such an index would help us locate all the series with certain labels, allowing us to quickly query, for example, all the http_requests_total timeseries that match a given handler or response code.</description>
