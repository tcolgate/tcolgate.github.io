      <description>Note: This was originally posted on the Qubit Engineering Blog, and CopyRight is, at the time of writing, owned by Coveo. It was written, and illustrated, by me, but would have been unreadable but for input and editing by my fantastic teammates.
Note: Much of the information discussed here is considerably out of date, whilst the broad approaches discussed could still be applied, most of the specific config and APIs have changed.</description>
