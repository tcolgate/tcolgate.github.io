      <description>Note: This was originally posted on the Qubit Engineering Blog, and CopyRight is, at the time of writing, owned by Cove. It was written, and illustrated, by me, but would have been unreadable but for input and editing by my fantastic teammates.
In this post, we will show a worked example of building a Prometheus alert for a typical user facing service.
Introduction At Qubit we have recently completely
a migration from our legacy Shinken and Graphite based monitoring to a system built around Prometheus, a modern time series database.</description>

      <description>Note: This post describes an extension to Prometheus that is unlikely to ever make it upstream, and definitely not in its current form.
Time Series Indexing When we talk about an index for a time-series database, we are usually talking about an index of the metadata. In the case of Prometheus, such an index would help us locate all the series with certain labels, allowing us to quickly query, for example, all the http_requests_total timeseries that match a given handler or response code.</description>
